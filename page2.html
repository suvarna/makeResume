          10 Resume Tips That Will Help You Get Hired
          </div>
        </div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="h1">1. Know the purpose of your resume </div>
        <div class="p">Some people write a resume as if the purpose of the document was to land a job. As a result they end up with a really long and boring piece that makes them look like desperate job hunters. The objective of your resume is to land an interview, and the interview will land you the job (hopefully!).</div>

        <div class="h1" id="two">2. Back up your qualities and strengths</div>
        <div class="p">Instead of creating a long (and boring) list with all your qualities (e.g., disciplined, creative, problem solver) try to connect them with real life and work experiences. In other words, you need to back these qualities and strengths up, else it will appear that you are just trying to inflate things.</div>

        <div class="h1" id="three">3. Make sure to use the right keywords</div>
        <div class="p">Most companies (even smaller ones) are already using digital databases to search for candidates. This means that the HR department will run search queries based on specific keywords. Guess what, if your resume doesn’t have the keywords related to the job you are applying for, you will be out even before the game starts.<br>These keywords will usually be nouns. Check the job description and related job ads for a clue on what the employer might be looking for. You can read more about resume keywords on the article Tapping the Power of Keywords to Enhance Your Resume’s Effectiveness.</div>

        <div class="h1" id="four">4. Use effective titles</div>
        <div class="p">Like it or not, employers will usually make a judgment about your resume in 5 seconds. Under this time frame the most important aspect will be the titles that you listed on the resume, so make sure they grab the attention. Try to be as descriptive as possible, giving the employer a good idea about the nature of your past work experiences. For example:</div>

        <div class="h1" id="five">5. Proofread it twice</div>
        <div class="p">It would be difficult to emphasize the importance of proofreading your resume. One small typo and your chances of getting hired could slip. Proofreading it once is not enough, so do it twice, three times or as many as necessary. If you don’t know how to proofread effectively, here are 8 tips that you can use.</div>

        <div class="h1" id="six">6. Use bullet points</div>
        <div class="p">No employer will have the time (or patience) to read long paragraphs of text. Make sure, therefore, to use bullet points and short sentences to describe your experiences, educational background and professional objectives.</div>

        <div class="h1" id="seven">7. Where are you going?</div>
        <div class="p">Including professional goals can help you by giving employers an idea of where you are going, and how you want to arrive there. You don’t need to have a special section devoted to your professional objectives, but overall the resume must communicate it. The question of whether or not to highlight your career objectives on the resume is a polemic one among HR managers, so go with your feeling. If you decide to list them, make sure they are not generic.</div>

        <div class="h1" id="eight">8. Put the most important information first</div>
        <div class="p">This point is valid both to the overall order of your resume, as well as to the individual sections. Most of the times your previous work experience will be the most important part of the resume, so put it at the top. When describing your experiences or skills, list the most important ones first.</div>

        <div class="h1" id="nine">9. Attention to the typography</div>
        <div class="p">First of all make sure that your fonts are big enough. The smaller you should go is 11 points, but 12 is probably safer. Do not use capital letters all over the place, remember that your goal is to communicate a message as fast and as clearly as possible. Arial and Times are good choices.</div>

        <div class="h1" id="ten">10. Do not include "no kidding" information</div>
        <div class="p">There are many people that like to include statements like "Available for interview" or "References available upon request." If you are sending a resume to a company, it should be a given that you are available for an interview and that you will provide references if requested. Just avoid items that will make the employer think "no kidding!"</div>
