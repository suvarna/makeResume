      <div class="p" id="para1">There are three things that make a great resume: An impressive content, beautiful and neat design and perfect wording. The first part you will have to take care of yourself – by getting experience and skills that will make you stand out. The second thing you don’t have to worry about because with the help of Kickresume you can design your kick-ass resume in minutes.</div>
      <div class="p" id="para2">When it comes to words in resume, that’s where the thing gets tricky. You have to be careful about your choice of words. Many phrases that were once popular in resume writing became cliché buzzwords that we don’t recommend using. They’ve been overused so many times the hiring managers simply got tired of reading them all over again so if you want to stand out, keep them out of your resume. On the other hand, there are some power words the recruiters strongly advise to use to make you look more competent and professional.</div>
      <div class="p" id="para3">When picking the right words for your resume, you should take the job description into account, too. From how the job offer is advertised, you can clearly identify several keywords crucial for the position. Select the most important keywords describing the ideal candidate and repeat them on your resume because these are the specific characteristics you should have to get an interview invitation</div>
